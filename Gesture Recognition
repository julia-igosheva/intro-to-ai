  My teammate, Nick, and I will be designing a gesture recognition project that can recognize at least 3 different hand gestures through a built-in camera from our laptops using OpenCV and Jupyter. Our algorithm will respond to different hand displays from users and respond to their gestures accordingly through template matching. As long as the gestures displayed by the users are similar to the templates we fed to our algorithm, the accuracy and precision of identifying the hand shapes should be relatively high. That being said, since our camera and our code is not at its most advanced stage, certain factors may play a role in lowering the accuracy such as different lightning, background noise, or ambiguous hand shapes, which is why we also implemented a threshold.
