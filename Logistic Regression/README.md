# Logistic Regression 
CS440: Into to Artificial Intelligence

Given a training data that consists of various 8x8 matrices that represent handwritten images of a number digit between 0 and 9, my neural network was trained to be able to identify what the actual number really is. I assumed that the cost error would be high at first as no training has been done prior but as more images and training I fed the neural net, the accuracy should get higher and closer to 100%. I thought integrating 5-fold cross validation and backpropagation was a little challenging but eventually I did figure it out. The result is useful as it shows and suggests that a more complex neural network for image recognition can have a great impact on our society.

 The forward propagation allows the neural network to take in the weights, biases and the activation of the node and calculate the output of the function. The backward propagation calculates the difference/error between the calculated output and the actual output to allow the network to re-train and make adjustments. Doing so allows my neural network to improve on its own to provide me with the highest accuracy as possible.
